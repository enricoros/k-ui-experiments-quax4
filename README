    Quax is a  desktop zooming tool intended especially for web developers, but
  is very handy and friendly for newbies. There are few other tools for this
  task: XMag, KMag and KZoom. All of them are full featured applications 
  and take some time to figure how to use them. Quax is *very* easy to use.
