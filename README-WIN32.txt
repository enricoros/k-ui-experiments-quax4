
    Quax - A neat desktop zooming tool
  ======================================
  
  
  1) What is Quax?

    Quax is a  desktop zooming tool intended especially for web developers, but
  is very handy and friendly for newbies. There are few other tools for this
  task: XMag, KMag and KZoom. All of them are full featured applications 
  and take some time to figure how to use them. Quax is *very* easy to use.

    The only thing you need to know is to right click on Quax surface to get
  the menu.

    Web developers and graphics designer need fast access so they use shortcuts.
  
    For the moment there's no help file for Quax, but only a UNIX manual page.
  This can only be read if you install Cygnus environment (GNU/UNIX under
  MS Windows)


  2) How I'll install Quax?

    To compile Quax you need QT-2.3.0 Non Comercial Edition for Windows
  and MS Visual C++ 6.0. If you install them with default settings, then
  you may simply call the "compile-win32.bat" file. To cleanup after compile
  run "clean-win32.bat".

    To install Quax copy quax.exe somewhere when %PATH% variable can reach it.
  For example %WINDIR%, where it can be C:\WINDOWS, C:\WINNT.  


  3) How to obtain Quax?
  
    Go to http://www.ro.kde.org/quax/
  

  4) Where I can report bugs and whishes?

  5) Notes for WIN32 release
  
    a) For the moment there's a lack for "Hand" cursor.
    b) There's no native Windows help file
    c) Menu accelerators use lower case letters
