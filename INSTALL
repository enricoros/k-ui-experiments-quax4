   Quax Installation
 =====================

    Please keep in mind that you must:
  1) have Qt libraries installed
  2) have Qt development binaries and headers installed
  3) QTDIR environment variable point to your QT installation.

    Execute:

    ./configure
    make
    make install (as root)

   By default Quax will install under /usr/local. If you preffer other location, like /usr
   then install it running:
    
    PREFIX=/usr make install



  
   NOTE: Please check that your QTDIR variable is setup correctly.
   Verify like this:

     echo $QTDIR
 
   Also check that "include" and "library" directories are valid. Some Linux 
   distributions don't follow Trolltech directory structure.
   Verify like this:
   
     ls  $QTDIR/bin
     ls  $QTDIR/include
     ls  $QTDIR/lib


   Linux Mandrake 9.0
 ======================  

   The Mandrake seems to forgot to add symlinks for X related libraries.
 As a consequence, you cannot build Quax out of the box. You need to make
 symlinks by yourself. Please run as "root' user the following:
 
   cd /usr/X11R6/lib
   ln -s libX11.so.6.2 libX11.so
   ln -s libXext.so.6.4 libXext.so
   cd -
 
   Then ensure that QTDIR variable is properly set:
     
   export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3

   Also you need the QT3 development files installed. The following packages
 must be present on your system:  

   libqt3-3.0.5-7mdk
   libqt3-devel-3.0.5-7mdk
